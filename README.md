# LAB: Voting Application - Phase 4
I built the back-end for a Voting Application. The back-end will track organizations, polls, votes, users, and membership.

This lab is broken into multiple phases.

##Phase 4 Requirements
For phase 4 I will start adding token based authentication.

## Auth routes
[ ] signup route will be used to add new users
[ ] login route will be used to login a user
[ ] verify route will be used to test that a user is logged in

## Functionality
[ ] all routes require authentication
[ ] BONUS: only members can:
[ ] create polls in an organization
[ ] vote on a poll

## Testing

[ ] supertest to test all your routes

## Rubric
2 point for User model
2 points for signup route
2 points for login route
2 points for verify route
2 points for token auth middleware
